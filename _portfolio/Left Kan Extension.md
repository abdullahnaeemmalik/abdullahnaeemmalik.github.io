Given a Delta Set (minus the maps), the output is a Simplicial Set (minus the maps). The input and output are in the form of a dictionary with keys = dimension and values = corresponding sets. Thus, we have ${0:X_0, 1:X_2,...,n:X_n}$. Each $X_i$ is a list, and each element of any $X_i$ is a list of size i+1 representing a simplex with its order. The script is available [here](/files/KanofDelta.py).
