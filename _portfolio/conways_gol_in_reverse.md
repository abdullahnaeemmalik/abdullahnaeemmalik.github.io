This project was completed as a part of a certification requirement for the _Datascience Bootcamp_, delivered by The Erdos Institute. This project finds the initial configuration of a grid, given an evolution, using Bayesian Classification. The notebook may be found [here](/files/Conway's_Reverse_Game_of_Life.ipynb). You can view my completion certificate and a video presentation of the project [here](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/spring-2023/data-science-boot-camp/abdullah-naeem-malik).
