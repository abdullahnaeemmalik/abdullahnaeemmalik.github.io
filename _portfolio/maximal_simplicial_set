For a basic introduction on the core idea, please refer to [this](/files/Maximal Implementation.pdf) PDF file. The python script presented [here](/files/maximal.py) has additional features, not covered in the documentation.
To construct a simplicial set, given a collection of ordered vertices, please see [this](/files/X_n given V.py). A way to construct maps of the trivial simplicial set is present in [this](ZeroSimplex.py) class.
