The Jupyter [notebook](/files/Adjacency matrix approach for simplex identification.ipynb) contains the necessary theory and all code, including sample graphs to test the code. Comments have been added to the code to ease reading. A related poster presentation on the idea may be found [here](/files/Poster(48_36).pdf).
