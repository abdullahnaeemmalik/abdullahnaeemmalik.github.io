excerpt: 'The theory of quantum mechanics, developed as a limiting case to classical me-
chanics, notwithstanding its interpretive di¢ culties, has with it the elegance
for paving way to a variety of applications. One such application is the imple-
mentation of a working Quantum Computer. The push one receives for using
quantum principles as a measure of information and execution of algorithms
is from quantum parallelism. It seems as though nature hides its enormous
calculations. One such realisation of the power of Quantum Parallelism can
be seen with quantum optics when one considers engineering a Quantum Com-
puter, choosing techniques of cavity QED amongst many other competitors. The
Deutsch-Josza algorithm, although of little practical signicance, is an encour-
aging example which greatly reduces the time required for a specic function to
be determined completely, when compared with its classical counterpart. The
Hadamard gate has been physically realised, and so has the other unitary trans-
formations in the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using di¤erent times of interactions
in the cavity. Also, a generalisation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has been
discussed, which might pave way for a working model of a Quantum Computer.'
