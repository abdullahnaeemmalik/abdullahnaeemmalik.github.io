excerpt: 'The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the Hilbert Space requirement for
Quantum Mechanics. In particular, we justify sharp observables but question
the requirement of completeness of the inner product space and the
underlying field. We view our mathematical framework as a dynamical theory
but with a mysterious probabilistic interpretation instead of the otherway
round. Whenever we speak of "Quantum\ Mechanics", we mean Non-relativistic
Quantum Mechanics. To make things less messy, we assume associativity
through-out. No attempt has been made to refer to QFT and statistical
quantum mechanics and we use conventional mathematical symbols instead of
Dirac's formalism.'
