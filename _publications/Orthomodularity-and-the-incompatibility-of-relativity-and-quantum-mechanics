collection: publications

excerpt: 'We show that orthomodularity in general and non-existence of isotropic vectors in particular decisively yield the geometry of quantum mechanics and that a fundamental reason why quantum mechanics and relativity cannot be unified is because of the non-existence of isotropic vectors'
