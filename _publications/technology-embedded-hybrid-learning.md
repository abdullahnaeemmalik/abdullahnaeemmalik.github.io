permalink: /publications/technology-embedded-hybrid-learning
excerpt: 'This preprint is a culmination of the proposal that marked the introduction of hybrid courses to COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, and the evolution of its model as an amalgam of the traditional class room model augmented with the aid of state-of-the-art online learning technologies. Two hybrid courses were offered to full-time students, with all the courses in traditional classroom mode, except one course offered as hybrid course, with both synchornous and asynchronous learning modalities. A survey and its results of the pilot program are presented.'
