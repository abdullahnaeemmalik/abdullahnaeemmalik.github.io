Differential Cohomology is a cohomological theory which extends topological cohomology theories. These latter generalized cohomology theories are those which satisfies Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, an example of which is singular cohomology. Differential Cohomology extends topological cohomology by taking into account geometric data of the underlying topological space. In this talk, we review the basic construction of ordinary differential cohomology in the spirit of Simons and Cheeger and then talk about the axioms of Differential Cohomology. [This](/files/Haine.pdf) document contains all of the details of the talk.
