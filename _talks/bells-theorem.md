Recent Nobel in Physics went to the pioneering experimentalists who helped lay foundations for Quantum Information Science. However, what the experiments also do is displace unsettling questions in philosophy out from the domain of social sciences, by bridging the physics of John Stuart Bell towards empirically verifiable claims. This is accomplished by exhibiting systems that violate an inequality, known as Bell&apos;s Inequality. In this talk, we will delve into the details of Bell&apos;s Inequality and discuss its assumptions, advancements that led to the development of Bell&apos;s Theorem, and its implications for the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.
