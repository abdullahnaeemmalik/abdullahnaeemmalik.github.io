        "The data consists of 0's and 1's placed in a grid of 25x25. The starting grid is randomly initialized. The Game of Life is then run for 5 steps. This allows the introduction of nonlinearity in the evolution. After these 5 steps, the state of the game is recorded. This is then treated as the starting point of the board (called start variables in the dataset). The game is then run for a minimum of one and maximum of five iterations. This number of steps the game evolves into is called the delta value in the data set. After delta steps, the game stops and the state is recorded again (called stop variable in the dataset). If a game dies off in this evolution, the game itself is discarded.\n",

The key performance index is the accuracy of classification, as a ratio of the correctly classified starting configurations against 50,000. That is correctly predicting the entries in the vector $\\textbf{y}$. Each $\\textbf{y}$ is indexed by the `id` indexing variable in the csv file.\n",

As a baseline model, we can use Multilinear regression, in which case the above norm should be treated as an $\\ell ^2$ norm that needs to be minimized.Treating this problem as a classification problem, we are then bound to the $\\ell ^1$ norm. This turns out to be equivalent to the accuracy of classification, which we want to maximise.\n",
