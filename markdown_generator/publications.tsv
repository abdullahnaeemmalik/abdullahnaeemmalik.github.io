2012-02-01	Engineering Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm in Cavity QED via Bragg Regime	COMSATS Institute of Information Technology Undergrad Thesis	The theory of quantum mechanics, developed as a limiting case to classical mechanics, notwithstanding its interpretive difficulties, has with it the elegance for paving way to a variety of applications. One such application is the implementation of a working Quantum Computer. The push one receives for using quantum principles as a measure of information and execution of algorithms is from quantum parallelism. It seems as though nature hides its enormous calculations. One such realisation of the power of Quantum Parallelism can be seen with quantum optics when one considers engineering a Quantum Computer, choosing techniques of cavity QED amongst many other competitors. The Deutsch-Josza algorithm, although of little practical significance, is an encouraging example which greatly reduces the time required for a specific function to be determined completely, when compared with its classical counterpart. The Hadamard gate has been physically realised, and so has the other unitary transformations in the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using different times of interactions in the cavity. Also, a generalisation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has been discussed, which might pave way for a working model of a Quantum Computer	Malik, Abdullah Naeem.

2016-04-01  Operator Algebras and the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics  Quaid-i-Azam University The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the Hilbert Space requirement for Quantum Mechanics. In particular, we justify sharp observables but question the requirement of completeness of the inner product space and the underlying field. We view our mathematical framework as a dynamical theory but with a mysterious probabilistic interpretation instead of the otherway round. Whenever we speak of Quantum Mechanics, we mean Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics. To make things less messy, we assume associativity through-out. No attempt has been made to refer to QFT and statistical quantum mechanics and we use conventional mathematical symbols instead of Dirac's formalism.

2022-25-01  Technology-embedded Hybrid Learning  Preprint  In this paper, we present the recently piloted project by COMSATS University Islamabad (previously known as COMSATS Institute of Information Technology) which is driven by technology-embedded teaching model. This model is an amalgam of the traditional class room model with the aid of state-of-the-art online learning technologies	Behzad, M.; Adnan, N.; Naeem Malik, A.; Merchant, S.A.
